    - Leverage machine learning algorithm to identify whether the given to binary functions are similar for not.
    - It helps to extract the information about the unknown target binary, hence identify the third-party software components present in the binary which also assists in performing security analysis of the target.
    - I worked on the back-end dataset generation, feature extraction from binaries cfgs (Control flow graphs), and feature vectorization to get embedding vector corresponding to each feature of respective functions. After this, I worked on applying these MLP, and CNN algorithms on these dataset.
