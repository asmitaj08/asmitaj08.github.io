Hello! I'm Asmita, a PhD candidate at UC Davis in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My passion lies in the fascinating world of embedded firmware security, with a particular focus on firmware fuzzing.

My journey into this domain began during my undergraduate years in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering in India. In my third year, I discovered the captivating realm of embedded systems, which led me to choose this path, even when lucrative opportunities from software-based industries beckoned.

I commenced my career as an embedded developer at one of the research centers in India, followed by a similar role at a startup. It was during these experiences that I first encountered the intriguing world of security challenges within embedded systems. The realization hit me hardâ€”I needed to comprehend how these attacks occurred to effectively defend these systems.


With this in mind, I made a pivotal shift in my career to become a security consultant. In this role, I conducted penetration testing on a wide range of IoT devices, spanning from medical devices and automotive ECUs to smart cameras and routers. This unique perspective granted me profound insights into the myriad attack surfaces and methods that embedded and IoT devices face.

The challenges associated with security assessments, particularly firmware assessments, deeply intrigued me. This curiosity propelled me to pursue a PhD, where I could delve even deeper into this research domain. I aim to explore the unsolved challenges, discover innovative methods to tackle them, and contribute to the development of tools and methodologies that enhance the security assessment of embedded firmware.

Currently, my research focus revolves around the application of fuzzing techniques to enhance firmware security assessment. I'm excited to share more about my research and provide valuable insights into embedded security on this website.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my journey and discoveries with you.<br>
