**Why embedded security?** 

Embedded devices have become an integral part of our lives, seamlessly blending into various aspects of our daily routines. From our everyday consumer gadgets to complex automation systems, from mission-critical infrastructure to the vast landscape of IoT (Internet of Things) devicesâ€”embedded technology is ubiquitous.


These devices consist of both hardware and firmware, forming the bedrock of the IoT ecosystem. While we celebrate their widespread adoption and utility, it's crucial to underscore the paramount importance of considering their security.
In the rush to bring innovative devices to market quickly, security aspects are often given a back seat. Factors like time constraints, resource limitations, cost considerations, or even a lack of awareness can lead to this neglect. However, this oversight can pave the way for potential threats and vulnerabilities in the system.


Imagine a scenario where a critical IoT device, responsible for a vital function, is compromised due to an insecure hardware component or a vulnerability in its firmware. Such breaches not only endanger the device itself but also expose a cascading risk, potentially affecting the entire system. Even if the software layer is secure, a hardware-level vulnerability can render all other security measures futile.


One of the most daunting challenges lies in the irreversibility of certain security breaches at the hardware layer. Unlike software vulnerabilities that can be patched and updated, security issues rooted in hardware may necessitate a complete overhaul or, in some cases, scrapping the entire hardware infrastructure. This not only poses a substantial financial burden but also undermines trust and reputation, which can be even more costly in the long run.


In upcoming posts, I will delve deeper into the realm of embedded security. We will explore the various types of threats that target both hardware and firmware in embedded devices. Later, I will narrow down to firmware security.

Let's explore "Embedded Security" !! Stay tuned!!
