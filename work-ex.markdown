## Exploring the World of Cybersecurity and Embedded Systems

### Firmware Security Intern
**Netrise, USA** - Summer 2023

- Conducted research and development on IoT firmware fuzzing, exploring tools such as AFL++, LibFuzzer, LibAFL, and OSS-Fuzz.
- Investigated the use of LLM (Large Loop Modes) in fuzzing techniques.
- Tested and analyzed 263 BusyBox packages for potential vulnerabilities.
- This work assisted Netrise in developing an initial test prototype for incorporating firmware fuzzing into their framework.

### Firmware Security Intern
**Netrise, USA** - Summer 2022

- Led research and implementation efforts for Control Flow Graph-based static analysis.
- Prototyped binary function similarity using Python to enhance firmware analysis.
- Contributed to identifying third-party software components in firmware targets.
- This contribution helped Netrise create a Proof of Concept (PoC) for adding binary similarity identification features to their framework, enhancing the identification of third-party software components more accurately.

### IoT Security Consultant
**Payatu, India** - October 2019 to September 2021

- Conducted embedded hardware and firmware security assessments, including IoT protocol analysis and basic side-channel and fault injection attacks.
- Performed security assessments on a wide range of IoT products, including smart cameras, medical devices, access control systems, wireless modems, and ECUs.
- Served as a security architect for an automotive client, integrating security into product design.
- Delivered training sessions on IoT hacking, training approximately 50-100 participants at events like Nullcon, CPX360 Checkpoint and other organizations.
- Contributed to the Expliot framework ([Link](https://gitlab.com/expliot_framework/expliot)).
- Authored insightful blogs on cybersecurity topics ([Link](https://payatu.com/author/asmita-jha/)).
